### Motivation

When I started to get into more advanced Machine Learning, I started to see how these famous neural network
architectures(such as EfficientNet), were doing amazing things. However, when I tried to implement these architectures
to problems that I wanted to solve, I realized that it was not super easy to implement and quickly experiment with these
architectures. That is where QuickAI came in. It allows for easy experimentation of many model architectures quickly.

### Dependencies:

Tensorflow, PyTorch, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Numpy, and Hugging Face Transformers. You should install TensorFlow and PyTorch following the instructions from their respective websites. 

### Why you should use QuickAI

QuickAI can reduce what would take tens of lines of code into 1-2 lines. This makes fast experimentation very easy and
clean. For example, if you wanted to train EfficientNet on your own dataset, you would have to manually write the data
loading, preprocessing, model definition and training code, which would be many lines of code. Whereas, with QuickAI,
all of these steps happens automatically with just 1-2 lines of code.

### Issues/Questions

If you encounter any bugs, please open a new issue so they can be corrected. If you have general questions, please use the discussion section. 


### Credits
Most of the code for the YOLO implementation was taken from "The AI Guy's" [tensorflow-yolov4-tflite](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite) repo. Without this, the YOLO implementation would not be possible. Thank you!
